# AI-Powered Health Risk Prediction System

This project is an AI-powered health risk prediction system designed to predict the risk of six major diseases:
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Heart Disease
- Kidney Disease
- Liver Disease
- Asthma

The system combines Machine Learning models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to not only predict disease risk but also provide medically grounded explanations for each prediction.

Unlike traditional black-box ML models, this project focuses on interpretability and explainability, which are critical in healthcare applications.
